## Project Structure
The descriptions of principal files in this project are introduced as follows:
* ./data/ : processed data are under in this folder, and the results of experiments will be generated here.
* ./data_util/
  * dataset.py : codes for generating the dataset for our model
* ./models/
  * resnet/ : codes for resnet models
  * tools/ : codes for some model tools
  * vgg/ : codes for vgg models
  * deeplab3plus.py : codes for DeepLab v3+ model
  * deeplabv32.py : codes for DeepLab v3 model
  * fcn.py : codes for FCN models
  * gcn.py : codes for GCN model
  * padded_unet.py : codes for UNet model
  * pspnet.py : codes for PSPNet model
* ./pretrained_models/ : pretrained_models (e.g. 3x3resnet50-imagenet.pth)
* ./caffe_pb2.py : codes generated by the protocol buffer compiler for PSPNet building. source: caffe.proto
* ./demo.py : codes for demo
* ./evaluate.py : codes for evaluating models
* ./main_withargu.py : the main function for training and testing models
* ./plot.py : code for the visualization of experimental results
* ./utils.py : containing useful codes that are required in the project (e.g. dataloader, model save, model train, model test, metrics calculation)
